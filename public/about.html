<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat", <br>
  is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat<br>
  Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters. He desires to find<br>
  the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become<br>
  the Pirate King, which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he<br>
  has told only to Shanks, his brothers, and crew. He believes that being the<br>
  Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.
